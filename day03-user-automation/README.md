# Day 03 – User & Sudo Automation

Manually creating users and assigning sudo access is repetitive and error-prone.

This bash script that automates:

    User Creation
    Initial Password setup
    Giving Sudo Access
    Forcing to reset password after login

Usage pattern: ./create_user.sh <username>
